# machineLearning
A beginner, use kaggle data, just practice

All data for training and testing are from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/

# Last Story
Learned the basic algorithms of ML.
Learned how to pre-load data.
Learned how to analyse data and how to improve my model.
But...
My PC is too old to run large data. I have to give up ML.
Later, I will make my major on linux network programming.
